## Pet Adoption
In this project, you can browse a catalog of pets available for adoption. Detailed information about each animal is provided, and after registration, users can reserve a pet. Additionally, users can track vaccination status â€” whether an animal is vaccinated or not. Each pet is associated with its breed, size, and age.
